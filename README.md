# QWER-Hacks-Project
2021 QWER Hacks project (Jan 23 - 24)

Feel free to add any ideas down here:

So far, we know we want to use:
- Selenium
- an online API that generates random photos for the profile images
- Chatbot to talk to people
- Preferences based on user bio
- Should we add a user interface?
